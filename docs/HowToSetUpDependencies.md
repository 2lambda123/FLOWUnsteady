# How to set up dependencies needed for FlightVehicleSim (October 2019)
Note: currently this simulation tool functions only with Julia v0.6, thus the following will assume Julia v0.6 syntax.

## [Geometric Tools](https://github.com/byuflowlab/GeometricTools.jl): 

Dependencies:
- PyCall
- PyPlot
- Dierckx
- Roots
- QuadGK

Clone the package using Julia

```Pkg.clone("https://github.com/byuflowlab/GeometricTools.jl.git")```

If using MacOS, you'll want to add 

```export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/ParaView-5.5.2.app/Contents/MacOS/```

to your .bash_profile, swapping the 5.5.2 for whatever version of [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/download/) you have downloaded (you'll need to download it if you don't already have it).

## [FLOWVLM](https://github.com/byuflowlab/FLOWVLM)

Additional Dependencies for FLOWVLM:
- [CCBlade](https://github.com/byuflowlab/CCBlade.jl)

Clone the package using Julia

```Pkg.clone("https://github.com/byuflowlab/FLOWVLM.git")```

## [MyPanel](https://github.com/EdoAlvarezR/MyPanel.jl/blob/master/src/MyPanel.jl)

Additional Dependencies for MyPanel
